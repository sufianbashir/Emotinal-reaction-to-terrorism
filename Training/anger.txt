woke up to two awful new stories
i feel sick seeing all of the videos and images this morning of my thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected
one of the things i hate about these things is the assholes on both sides waiting with bated breath to score political points
keeping all of the victims and families of this horrible tragedy in our thoughts and prayers
these videos and photos of the are fucking terrifying  i can't believe this is the world we live in  unbelievable
why did i wake up to a horrible start for the week  more horrendous events in our country
i love my country  i hate to see her and her children in such pain
this post in no way intends 2 trivialize the tragic loss of life  my sincerest condolences the families of d victims in this horrible tragedy but live this tragedy daily
y all fall for the same shit every year
the media loves humanizing even the worst kind of white killers
but then happens and reminds us all that this country has a tendency to suck major
that they need to fix the fact that all these people can kill you willy fucking nilly if they want to
i m so sick of the  not right now  excuse  so exactly when
tragedies like the really put life in perspective and make you wonder how people could be that cruel
actually feel sick thinking about the   what will it take for gun control reform
one phrase you left out   this son of a bitch was a terrorist    or is that anger just reserved for athletes and show
praying for its a she that people have to scared to leave their homes due to sick crimes like these
horrible news to wake up to  another american terrorist with easy access to deadly weapons wreaks havoc on our peace
i hate to even think it
this shit with is crazy bro  i swear no where is safe anymore
love these selfish assholes who politicized a mass murder just hours after it happens  typical liberals
i am so saddened and angry about this shooting  my heart goes out to those lives affected  just numb
how can someone s life be fucked up that much to go take other peoples life s
thoughts and prayers n't gonna do shit  we need to take action
here's a thought  can we just stop fucking killing people for no reason
that's awful  prayer   love for all
whatever the reason is
he had no connection to international terrorist group  is this supposed to be a good news  my point is  it makes it worst
i hope that the vegas shooter burns in hell  what a piece of shit coward

who give a fuck what this terrorist liked if this was a muslim or black person you bitches would be singing a different tone
this horrible whats happening  prayers for everyone involved with this and prayers for my friends in vegas
just like our healthcare system that s fucked
to all victims of horrible gun shot in
how the media is so pissed that it was not isis motivated
i m asking is it to much not to politicized this tragedy also where is she when gang bangers kill each other
how is gun control working out in chicago  over 2700 dead this year   the whole damn point
hopefully that whatever happens in vegas does stay there and don't happen anywhere
truly awful scenes in over 50 dead in and you can bet the solution is for people to buy more guns
we need to and become united  hate and violence should never prevail
someone take guns off america for fucks sake
i swear i hate people  i m mad the shooter killed himself he should ve been beaten to death by the victims families
when will enough be enough of this bullshit  nothing changes
what a piece of fucking shit
i think we are go to find that this shooting was an attack against trump supporters and conservatives  i have seen the left sickly rejoicing
if one more person says this was not terrorism i'm gonna lose my shit
hope everyone here in vegas is safe and sound what a cruel world  when is this ever going to stop
my anxiety is so bad right now i hate thinking about what happened last night
i just lost another one of my base in   damn
i can't wait until we read about mental illness bullshit  this is terrorism
there are some sick people in this world
thoughts   prayers going out to victims and families of the horrible last night  this madness needs to stop
thoughts are in las vegas after hearing of the awful events  what the f... is happening with our world

fuck the dude in trumps press conference about who started asking about puerto rico  let's deal with this one today
i'm heartbroken  i'm sad  i'm pissed off  what will it take to implement gun control legislation in this country
why does his race matter   a horrible man took the lives of innocent people  his race had nothing to do with it
this women is a hero  sometimes the worst of times brings out the best in people
thoughts are with everyone in vegas right now  such a horrible world we live in
between or i'll take the knee anytime  the shooting should cause much more anger and talks  but i doubt it will
i hate innocent people had to lose their lives for an agenda that still wont work
dear be with the families help us to walk in not hate
if cops in vegas don t think was t an  act of terror  i d hate see what they think is
why is   a white american killing 20 people   equals   a bad shit guy doing bad shit   or   shooting   but not terrorism
what a complete piece of shit
im going to be sick to my stomach if this was an anti trump shooting  especially since he hit country music fans
i wish it wasnt so   it's fucking time 4 it seems we are in constant didn't have to happen
it's been a brutal weekend for fear   hate
so bigoted ass has to interject hating police into the   definition of
syndicate mma hosting a charity seminar to benefit the individuals and families affected by the horrible shooting on the strip
what the hell is happening to this world my heart goes out to all the people affected by this horrible tragedy
i have so much respect for the individuals  and their families  who sacrificed themselves to save strangers
another fucking mindless crime
wow what a fucking cunt
thoughts are all those who were in las vegas night  what a horrible tragedy
just woke up from the worst night of sleep in a long time    my thoughts and prayers to all of you affected in vegas
it seems like everyday something horrible happens
this feels like the year of hate
i wonder what goes on in peoples minds to do something as cruel and heartless to go and shoot people in
what is wrong with the world today   thank god they got the bastard
i m so fucking disinterested in the hundreds of think pieces on the that ll appear tomorrow  god forbid we actually act
karma is a bitch
second time in two years that i've woken up to a new   worst mass shooting in american history    nothing feels safe
the was and is an awful tragedy and the usa needs   nobody needs automatic weapons or assault rifles    1 x
omg this is so horrific   something serious must be done to prevent these horrible attacks to all

worst mass shooting in us history
fuck it  just name a golf trophy    thoughts   prayers invitational
idiots on left and right politicizing death and suffering  maybe shooter just hated modern c w
so sickening  america needs gun control  rest in peace to all those poor people
i'm already at my wits end with the hate in the world  and this is nothing compared to   but it's the same too
mortified by the news of the it's impossible to understand how someone could have that much hate in their heart
so ur theory hinges on the idea that tactimcdip shit who spent 4 hrs learning about when not to shoot is as well trained and as highly vetted as our military and leos
prayers to all of those effected by the horrible this world is becoming a really terrible place
there is no doubt that this angers me  how many more f ing massacres do we have to have until congress takes some action
the best creation of god has turned into the worst one  animals are far better than humans   they have more emotions than us
one of the cons of today social media can suck it  praying for and victims and families
in a world where everyone is kneeling  i saw many stand and run towards danger  russell beck
how have we come to this point  working out anger by firing bullets into large crowds  mass murder solves nothing
the worst casualty in all of may be our loss of shock that this type of thing could happen
how is hate created  and how can we stop it  prayers for the victims in las vegas
how many ppl have to die   can't we just stop this bullshit from happening
another morning of waking up and becoming sickened when i swipe to twitter's trending page  so fucking sad for everyone in injured or not

holy fuck
so so sad  left msm going to politicized n report most dangerous people in us is white males  seat back n watch msm agenda

to the liberals rejoicing at the death of alleged  trump supporters   you mother fuckers make me sick  you re the problem
how great is to support him in defending himself against all those dangerous and threatening concert goers
since 1968 more people have died in america due to guns than all american casualties in us wars combined  fuck you we
white men have always been and remain the most dangerous terrorism threat our country faces  the end
i really don t wanna hear shit about any good that the terrorist did in his life  treat him like what he is  a killer
we should definitely use this horrible
i don't know how the world became so fucked up

sometimes i just don't understand why people do such evil things this world is fucked up  all the best
i feel so sick  i hope everyone can find the strength and pull through very heartbreaking
sarah huckabee sanders says this is not the time time to talk about gun control  so when the fuck will be a better time

my thoughts go out to all the victims and people of the las vegas massacre  don't let hate fuel hate and come together as humanity was attacked
savage mocks the idea that a good guy with a gun could have stopped the
gun laws in america are sick  nobody needs an automatic firearm
can we talk about gun control now please so more sick people wont get guns and another tragedy wont happen
i don t understand how someone wakes up and decides to go out and try to kill as many strangers as they can
today is the worst
nothing but using a horrible event for a political agenda  not sure how you sleep at night
truly sick people in this world
sick bastards thats what they are those poor victims enjoying a great night out then wiped out forever rip
is now the time to talk about gun laws  huh  fuck you
everyone needs to calm down and stop spreading misinformation and let the situation work itself out rather then jumping to blasted conspiracy theories  every damn time
history will not forgive all who let hateful action    with no action because of money unimaginable in the usa
muslim americans still have to deal with this shit  the islamophobic right wing fake news and conspiracy theories

its sad how much hate is still in the world nowadays  spread love not hate
the orlando shooting is a hate crime before anything else
hate is all around
how can you hate strangers so much you want to take their lives away  simply for being who they are  disgusting
watching the news and crying so much over the report on just the worst thing  rip to all those lost
yes this was a horrible shooting but do you think gun control would really stop it does making drugs illegal stop drug use
call it a hate crime  it is not just religious extremism  it is also an act of homophobia
reading the comments on the conspiracies about all sound so god damn condescending  do those idiots really use that  cont
reading all this shit about the is making me physically ill
a hate crime
shocked and appalled to hear the news of the orlando shooting  terrorism and hate is tearing this country apart
which in and of itself should probably be a hate crime

it absolutely breaks my heart that people are so full of hate  prayers to the families of those we lost last night
i hope ellen is right  condolences to the loved ones of the victims  such a hateful act
the sad part about it all is three's some twisted and sick individuals who are happy about this
to those who say prejudice against the lgb community does not exist  watch the goddamn news
there is a fine line between love hate  apathy is the opposite of hate love
muslim hating homophones must be in quite the pickle in terms of divided loyalties today
not acknowledging the terrorist faith as his motivation is both naive and dangerous
hate is a disliking human nature which leads to violence  to eliminate hate
lord help us render guns from the hands of crazies to the hands of the good and render hate from the hearts of all

the international outpouring of love in response to the reaffirms that   always take your fucking hate   shove it
