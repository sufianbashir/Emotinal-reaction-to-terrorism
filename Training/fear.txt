its funny when an american kills 50 innocent people and injures 200 and call him   gunman   and refuse to call him   terrorist

is a terrorist organization who supported who did not call a terrorist act  the only thing we seem to be united as a country is in praying after a tragedy has happened  people need more than warm condolences
calling him a terrorist  calling him a lone wolf  don't matter
waiting for the reports to say he was mentally ill  because somehow white terrorists are always mentally ill
prayers are not enough  elect officials who arendt afraid to change the laws
it's getting to the point where i'm afraid to turn on the news anymore
a terrorist is a terrorist  no matter the color of their skin or where they come from  anybody can be a terrorist
know people that where at the concert  so sad and so scary

so scary and sad with what happened in vegas

why are we not labelling this guy as a terrorist
may sound callous but battling to feel too much sympathy over as a nation us did nothing after the horrific sandy hook attack

the world needs to stay together when things like this happen  we are united and no terrorist attack could change or break us
more horrendous news from the us  must have been utterly terrifying  what is wrong with people
breaking  fbi now says that the suspect has no connection to any international terror organisation
who has called it a terrorist attack  the only terrorist is a white man with too many guns
i get the official definition of   terrorism    but ppl feeling   terrorized   by definition don't need a political part
cbtg's are with the victims and those affected by the horrific
it s insane how someone has no problem w  mass murder  i wish he was alive to face the consequence of being a terrorist
love to all the families involved in this horrific event  so sad we can't all live peacefully side by side

condemn this terrorism on behalf of all old white men
what a terrible tragedy that could have been prevented
this thing may just be a terrorist attack  the targeted crowd comprises of a certain type of people  tragic
how many more horrific incidents and innocent people are going to be killed because of the use of automatic weapons
las vegas shooter stephen paddock is a terrorist  wait
this is horrifying  one person can ruin so many lives
our fellow citizens were terrorized  kids were at concert  use ur platform 2 lead charge on
is not linked to one particular group of people regardless of what you are told was an act of domestic terrorism
starting the day finding out that hundreds of people have been shot is horrifying  praying for the victims and families
thinking of everybody in las vegas  absolutely horrific
has made a statement about this terrorist that killed all of these innocent people here in las vegas yet
why do such terrible things have to happen
the world is full of terror   yep thats our world   my prayers to the victims of hoping that everybody spread peace   unity
i am of the opinion that this is an act of terror  this wouldn't be tolerated in our society
isis only want to take credit to spread fear
horrific terrorist attack in last night  thoughts and prayers go out to those who lost there lives and those affected  such tragic news
if trump does call this guy a terrorist
thoughts and prayers go out to our friends at the las vegas chamber and all those affected by this horrific tragedy
still not a peep or tweet from the over the latest home grown terrorist attack in
my heart goes out to all affected by this terrorist    let s learn to love and not
so were not gonna call this a     it sure was  a horrific why n't his photo everywhere
the world has become such a scary place
prayers go out to the victims of this horrific act of terror in   pure evil  at a loss for words th
scary to even watch this for it sadness my heart to see this going on
who needs terrorists when you got this much domestic violence
lend your prayers for the terrible   this has to stop
not terrorism but evil per trump
latest  says no  specific credible threat  to other public venues in you s  after
white terrorist killing scores in
so just a question  what constitutes an act of terrorism
why are we not calling it for what it is  terrorism  even isis wants to claim it  white   lone wolf
isis had threatened in may
keeping the family of victims of horrific tragedy at in prayers
2  but i am confused why the media is saying   this is not a terrorist act
reason why media don't call las vegas terrorist   terrorist   but a shooter
i can't believe the horror i woke up  prayers going out to all the victims families and those who had to witness this
the media may have trouble trying to say terrorist when victims were very likely trump supporters
another major terrorist attack at a concert
call it a terrorist attack
guns guns homegrown terrorattack this is a terriost attack    trump the gunman
this is why we need gun control to stop domestic terrorism in its tracks  50 people didn't need to die today
another shooting n mass murder in las vegas bt this one int being treated as a terrorist incident according 2 the police
terrorism is terrorism  just because he don't look like what you   expect   him to look like does not change that fact
a terrible mass shooting happened in vegas couple of hours ago    terrifying
our thoughts are with everyone who suffered in this terrible tragedy in las vegas
if anyone is a terrorist reading this just kill yourself now spare the world your dying self pity and self loathing   die
so he is not a terrorist
nothing like waking up to terrorism  keeping the people directly impacted by this on the top of my mind
my heart breaks for everyone affected in vegas  this world is such a dark scary place  praying for the families victims
people being upset haunt been called a terrorist  that is not what is most important  pray for victims instead
these acts keep happening seems like the us has there hands full this looks like a terror attack we have to stay strong
processing horror of 1 has 2 wonder how the hell this guy was able 2 amass arsenal and thousands of rounds of ammo in room
the fact that this has become somewhat normal is beyond sad and horrific
the sounds of the long streams of automatic fire in the videos are horrifying and upsetting  disturbing destructive force
lone wolf you mean terrorist
needs to call it what it is  stephen paddock is a terrorist not evil
how many times will he say terrorism
terror     extreme fear   therefore someone who causes   extreme fear   is a    terrorist  call it what it
why are we not calling a terrorist attack
praying for everyone involved in the horrific attack in las vegas
this nevada kid sends all of her love to and everyone touched by this terrible tragedy
the americans need to revisit the meaning of   terrorism
when will we learn to unconditionally care about other people  even the most horrifying acts don't seem to help
more left wing terrorism
so the guy who killed 50 people is called   a lone wolf    of course coz he is not muslim so he can't be a terrorist
how can 1 man have access to such a mass killing machine   not be called a terrorist after he murdered   injured so many
god bless the victims and their families of   i can't imagine the horror and sense of loss    truly heartbreaking
my condolences to the victims and families of the terrible las vegas shooting

that moment when rana ayyub repeatedly 'gloats' on twitter of   innocence   of islamic terrorism in
terrorism comes in all sizes
i can t sleep thinking about how terrible this attack is  i m so upset
'terrorists are always muslim but never white'  at the intersection of crt   propaganda

so we wake up to another horrific mass shooting  the new norm in america  my heart breaks for all those killed   hurt
america has a very clear face it s given to terrorism it does t look like this shooter although this is clearly terror
i just do not understand how anyone could be against in america  what are you afraid of
just because the las vegas shooter was white don't mean hers not a terrorist
if stephen paddock was of any other race this would be labelled as terrorism
what happened in vegas was an act of terrorism by a terrorist who happens to be white  stop the nonsense
it s scary how sometimes we just turn our backs on each other
after the horror of the the world waites with baited breath to see what utter crap will come out with
no specific credible threat to other public venues in us
how do we find answers in the wake of a massacre  how do we respond to the fear terrorism like this invokes
domestic terrorism
prayers to injured n families of the dead in the we must remain united and defeat terrorism
not a terrorist until proven muslim
i care if you are related to a terrorist group  you kill this many people you are a terrorist
is it a terrorist attack     sure gunman religion might have known
music is never something someone should be afraid to experience  our hearts and minds go out to those affected by the
such a scary place we all live in now
why in t a terrorist attack
and now they got the reason to not just declare hafez saeed or others as terrorism because thats not gonna help

a terrible tragedy took place in las vegas last night  our hearts are with the victims and their families today
when will they start calling it a terror attack
this man was a terrorist  not a  lone wolf  i don t care how he spent his retirement
what's this a terrorist attack or someone with a mental illness
horrific and barbaric   prayers with the dead and injured of
heartfelt condolences to the victims of terrorism in   prayers for the speedy recovery of those who are injured
i don't know anything about   why n't this being called a terrorist attack
call that monster a terrorist
it's time to change the definition of terrorism
meanwhile   more from columnist who said was   clearly coordinated muslim terror attack
the uk govt could threaten a travel ban until this issue is dealt with like happened with tunisia  time to get guns banned
waking up to this news videos are horrifying    prayers to everyone there and condolences to families of the deceased
our condolences to the people of   know our hearts poor in wake of this terrible tragedy  please help by donating blood

since the shooter is white   probably christian then hers a local shooter later a lone wolf   mentally ill except terrorist
my heart goes out to all the fallen and their families of the terrible shooting in las vegas
what happened last night is the definition of   race don't define terrorism
this world is so terrifying and i can't believe what i keep hearing  my thoughts are with las vegas and everyone affected
none of my friends and family were hurt by the horrors last night
idk why we are worried about n korea  give us time and we will kill ourselves
this is a sad day  we need to address white terrorism
if the guy is latino black or muslim they would be drug lords gangs or terrorists not mentally ill right
act of pure evil  don t you mean an act of terrorism
he wasnt just a terrorist but a
police say the white gunman in las vegas n't a terrorist  nevada state law defines a mass shooting as a terror attack
not a terrorist   really
my guess  statement will not mention terrorism terrorist re cause it would change assumptions of fear and violence
that s it  that s your whole tweet about   yourtravel ban didn t stop this b c this is domestic terrorism  50 dead so far
terrifying way to wake up this morning after just getting home from vegas
we had a false alarm here at the area i've never been so scared
my heart goes out to all those affected due to the terror attack in i pray for peace
not going to spread the shooters name or picture   but know that he is a terrorist and terror knows no color
50  dead and over 200 dead would lead you to believe this was an act of terrorism
in moments of tragedy and horror
is the not being treated as a terrorist attack   seen no reference to terrorism at all
the question is what is terrorism
if it turns out this is an isis terrorist attack
yes this is terrorism
this shooting is making me fear public gatherings now
the biased media strikes again  the being referred to as a   lone wolf style attack    guaranteed if he was muslim it would immediately be a terrorist attack
ppl are sweeting about news avoiding terrorist term
the world is a scary place right now
a terror attack happened in or what shall msm call it  lone wolf white shooter attack
waiting for to call the las vegas shooting   radical domestic terrorism
praying for the victims and the families affected by the horrific tragedy in vegas last night
i've been sitting here watching the news  my thoughts are with those who were caught up in last night horrific attack
is it that hard to call a 64 year old white man a terrorist
work up to the horrific news of the   what in the world would possess someone to do this and be so evil
it's seems clear now that this terrorist had a modified semi automatic gun that made it fully automatic  during this   1
yes its hard to see a homegrown terrorist shooting at innocent people
prayers to all the victims of the horrific terrorist attack last night in las vegas
they will say it s terrorism  but it s the fault of the government no hospital care for psychic ex soldier s etc
what happened in las vegas was a terrorist attack plain and simple
i still havent seen one news outlet call or describe the attack in las vegas as terrorist attack
white male american gun terrorist murders a crowd of country music fans on sunday  stop gun fetishism  if not now
terrorism  lone wolf  isis recruit or active shooter
humans   dehumanising   other humans is terror  i fear humans acting as if their position grants them the right to judge others
how many people have to be slaughtered by terrorists for the you s  to take gun control seriously
terrorism has no religion islam is peaceful religion i pray that those people who killed in the attack may allah give patience to their families and those who are injured give them long and healthy life
worrying situations in and and a stark contrast in police actions   bravery and brutality
white privilege is the only thing keeping from being headlined as a terrorist  period  end of story
my thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims and their families of the   living through some scary times in this world
when its a muslim   terror
well i guess it didn t stay in vegas  what a terrible tragedy
the you s  don't consider the lv massacre an act of terrorism  seriously   those victims looked pretty terrorized to me
a terrorist attack
what a terrible news this morning
yes my friend terror is terror american on american murder  evil walks among us
say it with me terrorism  that's is what this is
terrible why happened in vegas  my prayers go out to the victims and their family  sad day
the says its premature to call an act of domestic terrorism  she says it's an ongoing investigation
that man was a terrorist intent on taking lives and causing terror call it what it is
i ve had more fun than should be allowed in vegas  to be terrorized at an event is absolutely horrifying and ghastly
we don't need the media nor the   powers that be   to condemn or label the shooter for what he is  a terrorist
so i havent seen the word terrorist used yet for the individual who opened fire in killing 50  must be wma
waiting for the media to say that the incident was done by a guy whos mentally unstable instead of an actual terrorist
fbi says no connection to isis or terror
we are overlooking the real threats to our country  homegrown
our thoughts   prayers are with all affected by the horrific events in
whats terrorism about is killing innocent people   this one did that   hers white so now they are still investigating
horrified to hear about the   my thoughts are with the victims  just glad it was t a terrorist attack
it was an act of pure terror  fixed it for him
on this sad day nor are able to say the word domestic terrorism  sad
when is a terrorist not considered a terrorist
ditto  it also affects all of us does it  what horror  whats the future for open venue concerts
my thoughts are with everyone affected in the   this is absolutely horrifying and this kind of evil needs to end
this is so so so sad and scary    no one should have to go through all of that
america is being attacked from within    local terror cells working as lone wolves
white american men are a bigger domestic terrorist threat than muslim foreigners
fear the white male terrorist
i wonder if considers this a terrorist act since the alleged perpetrator is a white american
v2000 more chance of being shot and killed in the us than to die from a terror attack
when these kinds of terror attacks become the norm    this wouldn't have happened in vegas or anywhere and i'm sorry
i don't understand why i'm not hearing this on the news  he's a terrorist by definition
i cannon even put into words my feelings about   this was an act of terrorism
thoughts and prayers for today  i can t even imagine the horror of being at a show being shot at by a psycho
fbi special agent in las vegas says   no connection   found so far between the shooter and an international terrorist group
there's an assumption that terrorists can't be white  you'd hope this would prove otherwise but for many i doubt it will
here is what we know about the terrorist attack in   he was white who terrorized a large crowd
how long before this administration calls this a terrorist attack  who votes for never
waking up to shooting horror has become the norm in this country  perhaps now would be a good time to talk about gun control
so this was just shooting and not terrorism because it was not by a muslim sounding name
thoughts and preys go out to vegas  what a terrible thing
2  thank first responders for dealing with aftermath that is no doubt dramatizing and horrific to witness
needs to be a muslim to be called a terrorist
you never understand how heart breaking a terrorist attack is til it happens in your hometown and you dont hear from people
why don't the media ever call it a terrorist attack when a white man kills a mass amount of people  terror is terror
terrorism for brown folk and evil acts for white folk for the families of the victims
my heart is in pain for all those affected by the   absolutely horrifying
i'm trying to understand why they given this mentally ill white man a free pass  call it what it is  he is a terrorist
before isis could react or take claim of fbi clarified that its not a terror act  played smart
why am i not seeing in my feed  multiple terror shooting not in my feet at 11 13 p m  pt
just love the way and other mainstream news outlets are choosing to focus on americas gun laws rather than the motivation behind the attack  wonder if the approach would be they same if the terrorist was muslim
are we calling this heinous act   domestic terrorism
what exactly goes on in the mind of a terrorist
ugh  waking up to some terrible and sad news    i heard the news today
you don t need to be part of an ideological group to be a terrorist
the normalization of guns and banality of fear
suspect not a terrorist but not
this was a terrorist attack  doesn't matter that the shooter was a white male  absolutely horrific
the las vegas shooter is a terrorist
gunshots echo in sin city  bloodshed and terror  but hope rises   with the sun   over the city of lights
45 talking about god like he is actually religious and believes what hers saying  still didn't call it domestic terrorism
prayers 50 innocents killed by a mentality ill or not is terrorism
he is a terrorist
terrible to hear what s going on around the world  thoughts go out to both edmonton and vegas  stay strong
so call the what it was  an act of terrorism  don't ask politicians or reporters  ask the concert goers at the scene
trump s travel ban would t have prevented this terror attack
terrible news as us record shooting stuns the world
our thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims of the terrible tragedy in las vegas last night  our hearts are broken
we unfortunately live in a sad and scary time now
absolutely terrifying  now watch as las vegas strip totally changes following this
it's beyond terrifying to think there are people walking among us that have zero compassion for other human beings  etc  etc  etc
such horrific news to wake up to  seriously
bets on if the word terrorist is said during the address today
call it what it is   it s still terrorism  terrorists don t need to be a specific race or religion
my prayers are with everyone in and who are terrified or hurt or experienced lost ones
with the how terrible this is        i don't mean any disrespect but i smell a rat   it's not adding up
if you watched kids killed   said nothing  but now you want to be a champion because you were threatened  you are inhuman
people are more scared of isis and mexicans even though white supremacist have killed more people in the us than them
becauee innocent people died at the hand of this domestic terrorist and thats what he was
crazy idea for the left and right  when three's a terrorist attack
when is terrorism going to stop
were the victims at terrified
a scary morning wake up call
nra is a domestic terrorist organization
mentally ill   and   lone wolf   are interchangeable with   white terrorist
we need 2 call this what it is   domestic terrorism  is a terrorist  it's not that difficult
not just first responders that need to worry
don't care about your religion you kill that many people your a terrorist
waking up to a terrible tragedy
call out the media when they try to normalize murder and terror
so unfathomable that someone could do something so horrific its a tragedy and my heart goes out to the victims
how many people does a white guy have to kill before the press calls it domestic terrorism
you'll notice the words terrorist act is not been freely used by d press concerning d cos its not clear if its political

what if everything was staged to appear to be a terror attack
fair   balanced left  odd that media n't calling white suspect a terrorist right  white shooter  obe   left anti-a
potential foreign terrorists are like
he is not a terrorist
in my eyes he is a terrorist  white
our thoughts   prayers are with those affected by the terrible events in las vegas
it was a pure act of terrorism  the man was a terrorist
two things we can learn from is that prayers don't stop shootings and trump will never call a white shooter a terrorist
aww come on   an act of pure evil    not r you scared to use the word  yeah ok donnie
call a spade a spade  this is domestic terrorism
if the is not terrorism
i want to be perfectly clear here  i have been screaming that the supports domestic terrorism like the through their work to fight gun control  i own a semi automatic rifle
i fear some ppl i know were down at the strip  it hurts a lot when something like this is at home  prayers to the victims
another morning with terrible news
yet more horrific proof that the problem in t muslims
it s crazy that you have to worry about your safety no matter where you go nowadays

usa media  if hers a muslim   terrorist if he's black or hispanic   thug if he's a white christian   mentally unstable
r i p to the innocent we gotta stop this madness  nobody should have to worry about losing a loved one like that
so when does a mass shooting become a terrorist attack
alex jones is doing his best to deflect blame for last nights terrorist attack away from trump  he is a liar

don't care what anyone says what happened last night was a terrorist attack it fits the definition to a t
of cos we know he is not a terrorist because he is white

our thoughts and prayers with las vegas victims of horrific massacre
my heart goes out to everyone of vegas right now  very scary
this was domestic terrorism  but more importantly

can someone explain the difference between a  mass shooting    a  terrorist attack other than the identity of the shooter
america is going through the most  domestic terrorism on the rise
so sad but the reality is world will not consider as terrorist attach or
the associated press   says had no connection to international terrorist group

terrorists have easy access to guns and ammunition  control
what is this quisling about whether to call stephen paddock a terrorist or not  anybody who intends terror is a terrorist
so i wonder if the vegas shooter will be named a  terrorist    probably not because he is white    sh
lone wolf or a terrorist
terrorizers mass shooting aka call for gun control

trump  i will give our intelligence community the tools they need to fight terrorism
just call it what it is radical islamic terrorism
the suspect recently bought two guns legally despite being investigated by fbi terrorism probes

to the islamic terrorists in this world
how mass killer was able to buy guns despite being on fbi threat radar   via

we know who this terrorist is  i am more interested in his victims  their stories forever matter more
what if i told you terrorists can make explosives easier than buying guns  evil is evil
livid over this terror attack on   i know i should be mournful but we as a nation should been reinstated assault weapons ban
50 dead  a targeted attack on people like me  what words can express the horror of such a thing
